Xeromatic
=============

This repo is designed to help new developers discover what a real-life project might look like in the web software industry, using basic implementations of a typical web stack. 
The completed website should allow users to pin and unpin their favourite tweets.

Check out the presentation in this repo to see what we will cover - *Xeromatic.pdf*.

It includes:
- [WebAPI](http://www.asp.net/web-api)
- [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline)
- [SSDT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh272686(v=vs.103).aspx)
- [xUnit](http://xunit.github.io/)
- [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net)
- [Bootstrap](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui)
- [React.JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

UI Improvements
- Navigation bar doesn't wrap neatly when page is resized
- Bottom of navigation links should align with bottom of "UN+YOUTH", above the thin black dividing line
- Once a tweet is pinned, "Pin" button should grey out
- Twitter @ handles should be links
- Photo capability? Or does that defeat the purpose of it being lightweight/basically just turns it into twitter.
- Header font should really be Gotham rather than Montserrat
- Links functioning as links, rather than part of just the string text
- Live updating
